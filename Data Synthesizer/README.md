In order to use the data synthesizer, you need to first download the Nvidia Data Synthesizer Plugin (NDDS) for UE4.

Then add the folder named 'Demos' into the Content folder in the project window.

Open the level with name "showcase_demo" and run the project. It will automatically generate data for you.

You can replace the target object in the scene with your custom objects.
